Harold Green: Where does cheese come from, anyway?
Red Green: I'm not sure but I think butter comes from leaving milk out too long.
Harold Green: Maybe cheese is butter that has been left out too long...
Red Green: Yeah, could be... but I always thought cheese was a urine product. No, maybe that's cheez-whiz.

This is a love song, more or less for my wife
She's the best thing - or one of the better things - to happen to me, in my life
I'd say what I am, I am because of her - but she wouldn't take that as a compliment
I consider to be perfect - or almost perfect, in a lot of ways
But she could back off on the nagging; that wouldn't hurt at all. Happy Anniversary, Bernice.

I go on my own TV show and sing a song
Oh well! At least I'm not a mole
Oh well! At least I'm not a mole - either kind
One I'm underground, totally blind
The other I'm a blemish on someone's behind
So put a smile on that long, long face... unless you're a mole, in which case I apologize for this insensitive song.

[Red enters the lodge, feeling depressed]
Red Green: Harold, if the people of this community ever find out what we did in that parking lot to that cow, I will never be able to hold my head up high again.
Harold Green: You actually did it, Uncle Red? You did that whole "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" thing to that poor little defenseless milk-maker?
Red Green: We chickened out, Harold, every last one of us. There wasn't one guy who could look into those big brown eyes and nail her with a sledgehammer. Guys were sobbing and they got misty-eyed. At one point, Moose Thompson asked the cow to marry him. This is a dark day for the image of Possum Lodge.
Harold Green: Well, I for one am very proud of you, Uncle Red.
Red Green: Don't make it worse, Harold. I don't know how many vegetarians there are in this country, but I bet most of them work in slaughter houses. Eating meat is like having kids: the less you know about it, the more likely you are to go ahead.
Harold Green: Well, I hope you apologize to the cow, because she's had a very stressful day.
Red Green: Oh, you can tell that by the back seat of Stinky's Cadillac.

Stage 1: You're a kid. All you have to park is your butt.
Stage 2: You're a teenager and are out parking with a girl who has a good chance of being your future wife.
Stage 3: You're married with kids and are now parking at a McDonald's with a play area.
Stage 4: The kids have grown and are working, coincidentally, at McDonald's. Meanwhile, you've bought yourself a sportscar and are caught parking with a girl who has no chance of being your future wife.
Stage 5: Now you're parking in the garage, where you're also living.
Stage 6: You're old; no license, no car, no parking spot.
Stage 7: You're parked. Permanently. You have your own parking spot. It even has your name over it.

Harold Green: Boy, people who don't even like the show are watching it now, ya know. It's like we're some big American network program or somethin'. Uncle Red, that is the power of hype. Hype works. Hype is cool. You don't have to have talent, good looks, brains, nothing, if you got enough hype.
Red Green: You know I was thinking hype could really help you, Harold. You're hyper now, so just back off one letter, and you're there.

[During "The Experts", Red is asked what type of food to prepare and serve for a cookout]
Red Green: Well, I find budget is the main consideration. For instance, we may be planning on having something like fish fry at the Lodge. 'Course, no one catches any. So we have to augment the menu and that always forces us over budget. And then we get all the whiners who want to know how the hot dogs and macaroni qualify as fish fry. So I just say, "Hey, just throw some worms in."
Harold Green: Well, you sounded serious at the time!

Oh, you got your book; you hear the knock
But you don't care; the door is locked
Let them pound and yell and scream and shout
You know what they want; you know what they need
But you got there first with something to read
And they'll just have to learn to do without
The john is the only place where a man
Can put up his feet and turn on the fan
And read a book and know what it's actually about
Oh, but don't let it go to the bitter end
'Cause every five minutes you lose another friend
And they'll all be waiting to kill you when you finally come out.

It is winter.
When I was young, we never had fights in hockey.
But we also never had helmets or protective padding or shields on our skate blades or smooth ice.

But we didn't have fights.
We didn't *need* fights.

Okay, you got new neighbors moving in down the street. They look okay from a distance. But as you're peering at them through your binoculars to see if their faces look familiar to you from TV shows like "America's Most Wanted", your wife comes running into the bedroom and tells you to put your pants on, she's invited the new people over. Now, I know you will have a negative reaction because you're thinking that you already know way more people than you want to know, and anyone who would buy a house on the same street as a chlorine factory is an idiot. Except you, of course. But you've got entirely the wrong attitude. When the moving van pulls into the driveway, you run right over. You say, "Howdy, neighbor," all the time keeping an eye on everything coming out of the van. What you're looking for are power tools, gardening equipment and a big-screen TV. When it becomes obvious that they're a little more better off than you are, you try and figure out some way to get together at each other's houses at least once a week, maybe even more often during playoffs. It's okay to give a little as long as you get a lot. That's called free trade.

Red Green: Okay, so Old Man Sedgwick's son has moved back in with him, and you can tell by the broken furniture out on the front lawn and the duct tape they got dividing the rooms exactly in half that things are really not going all that well. Now, you tell me, what is the worst thing that could happen out of that scenario?
Harold Green: Well, they could be heating their cabin, like, with a high-sulfur coal, you know? Then meanwhile, on top of the wood stove, both men are rinsing their teeth in the same pewter jar, right? And that would create this symbiotic hydrolysis, right? And then there'd be a thermal inversion, right? And then all of a sudden, the sulfur and ions, they'd have to collide with the dental plaque, right? And that'd accelerate the electrons to the point where there'd be this massive nuclear reaction, right? But it wouldn't kill them. Oh, no, it wouldn't kill them, Uncle Red. But indeed, yes, it would render them absolutely sterile for the rest of their lives!

Dalton Humphries: You say someone's stealing my slippers to annoy me? You know, it's probably my neighbor, you know, because he's trying to get me. Sometimes I sneak into his house at night and rearrange his furniture.
Red Green: All right, and he thinks that way because he's...
Dalton Humphries: ...caught me doing it.

I know you teenagers watch a whole lot of television and you get kind of a mixed-up view of what the world is really like. The worst thing is that TV makes crime look good, where actually crime is bad. First of all, there's no such thing as a criminal mastermind, okay? The prison population is not a brain trust. If you ever skimmed through the mugshots down at the police station, you know you're not looking at the MIT graduating class. And if you're a criminal, one of these guys is going to be your roommates for the next 20 years. Also, if you get into the criminal line of work, you got to work a lot of nights, there are zero benefits and no one will come to your patio dinner party because they're afraid there's going to be a drive-by shooting. Despite what you see on television, most criminals either get caught or killed or they have to change their identity and move to a country where there's nothing worth stealing. So I'm asking you to just say no to assault, break-and-enter, arson, murder, theft, drug trafficking, and, oh yeah, real estate sales.

Red Green: You're never too old to learn things.

Red Green: Well, would you be willing to pay 400 bucks an ounce for it, Harold? If not, then it's a bad thing, because that's how much we spent to dig the gold mine.

Red Green: Oh, yeah, and maybe I should've been born a millionaire. It's always money with you, isn't it, Harold? You need a tank moved, you pay someone. You need a roof reshingled, you pay someone. You need underwear, you pay someone. I just don't work that way, Harold.

It is winter.
We hitched the horse up to the sleigh, like Grandfather used to do.

Pretty soon, you're going to find yourself going on and on about every topic under the sun, and you're going to wonder, "Why am I suddenly the Encyclopedia Britannica in shorts and a T-shirt? And why this urge to tell anyone with ears?" Well, you're a middle-aged man now. And middle-aged men know everything. Oh, yeah. Middle-aged men know the best route on any highway from one place to another place. We know how to fix stuff. We know how to cut the lawn properly. We know everything. But you got to keep this knowledge to yourself, all right? I know that you know that your neighbor is planting that shrub the wrong way, but don't say anything. I too have seen my wife wallpaper the bedroom the hard way. Just keep your mouth shut, all right? Because when they found out how smart we are, they get jealous, all right? I don't know who said, "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing," but I'm guessing it was a middle-aged man. So whatever it is you know - and I know it's a lot - keep it under your hat and you'll be able to keep your friends. Believe me, I know.

Mike Hamar: Nothin'. I just saw the sign that said, "Pick your own". [Red stares at Mike, who realizes his mistake] Oh, I didn't know you're supposed to pay. They need a better system.

A poem by T. S. Eliot Green: "Let us go then, you and I, when the evening is spread out against the sky, like a patient etherized upon a table. Let us go through certain half-deserted streets, because, my friend, life is short. And how often do you get the chance to drive a snowmobile through a mall?"
%
You know, guys don't like to ask anybody for help. Women think it's because it makes us look weak, but that's not it. No, guys hate asking friends for help on a project because it means selling yourself into slavery. It's called payback work. If I ask a friend to help me do something smart like build a winterized garage for my snowmobile, then I'd have go help him do something stupid, like pour a cement pad for his rocket launcher. And why would I want to do that? If I've already finished my project, I don't want to do any more work. That payback work is nagging away in the back of your mind. Just like that relative living in the guest room. No matter what you say or what you do, it will not leave. You want my advice? You need something that needs to be fixed, hire a professional. If it's not bad enough to need a professional, fix it yourself and it will be. Believe me, you're better paying in cash once than paying in payback work the rest of your life.

I was in a war. Oh yeah, the big one: the Gasoline Price War of '69. I had lied about my age so I could get a job pumping gas at a Lloyd's Texaco. Then all "shell" broke loose. The Dutchman dropped his price by a nickel. We had to fight back, so we took the big hit and dropped our price down six cents. The war was on. Why, we started handing out hot dogs and balloons just to keep the customers. By the end of August, the entire station was under siege: people parking their cars outside, firing off their horns, screaming for free tumblers and nobody to hold them off except me and one-legged Lloyd. But we did it, and we won, and it made a man out of me. And I guess that explains the stain on my pants.

One of the things that changes as you get older is your attitude towards parties. That's because after you've been married for a while, you realize that men and women have totally different approaches to them. The woman wants to know who's coming to the party. The man just wants to know who's bringing the beer. The woman cleans up whatever is lying around the home so the guests will think she keeps a neat house. The man actually leaves tools lying around the home so the guests will help build a deck. The woman wants to know what's going on with everybody. The man avoids that information. It's safer. It prevents him from blurting out something he's not supposed to know in front of someone who's not supposed to hear it, especially if that someone is carrying one of the tools I mentioned earlier. So my advice is when you get to our age, stop going to parties. Bringing friends together for the sole purpose of letting loose is not a good idea. People are like nuts and bolts: they don't work well loose; there's too much play. If you want to have a wingding, you're better off in a bar full of strangers than a house full of friends. You want to go where the lights are low and people are all the same; you want to go where nobody knows your name.

Trapper Jack was hunting bear
A dangerous hobby at best

Mostly teeth and bones and hair
Jack had always been good with a knife
But unfortunately, not quite as good as the bear.

Primarily, it's a pride thing: we're out there in our own vehicles, burning gas, got the sunglasses on, looking good. People seeing us going by would have no idea where we are. And we're not really excited about sharing that information. A man does not embrace the concept of going up to total strangers and saying, "You may not know this, but I'm a moron," whereas the woman he's with is only too happy to share that information. I think that helps ease her burden a little. See, to a woman, getting lost on a trip is just a blameless act of nature. But to a man, it's a sign of personal failure. He knew where he was when left; he doesn't know where he is now. Somewhere along the way, he crossed the line between the world he knows and the world he doesn't know. And that's exactly how he felt about when he got married, and when he had kids. So if he admits he's lost in his car, he's gonna have to admit he's lost in those other areas as well. That's way too much to ask. So just sit there, bite your tongue, circle the block a couple of times. Men aren't lost, they just take the long way.

This was my granddaddy's farm
A hundred years ago

The water tastes like eggs
But luckily, the government stepped in
And paid him not to grow stuff which was more or less his specialty.

I want to talk to you guys about something that's going to happen to your wife that'll have a tremendous effect on you. You know, a woman gets into those middle years, and she this brief, biological urge to have just the one-more child. I don't know why. Maybe it's because her babies are grown, or maybe she sees a younger woman expecting. Or maybe she realizes that once the kids move out, she'll only have you. But believe me, parenthood at your age is not a good idea. As you're slipping into your second childhood, you don't need somebody around you just starting their first. And you don't want somebody else in the house who goes to the bathroom more often than you do. So here's what you do, okay? Borrow a baby just for the weekend. Find some new parents and babysit. You know, give them a little break. I'll tell ya, by the time you hit the 1 A.M. feeding your wife will be having second thoughts. And then the 3 A.M. colic fits, she'll be asking you to phone the parents. And by the 4 A.M. diaper change, she'll be praying for hot flashes! So just let nature take its course. Remember, I'm pulling for ya. We're all in this together.
