#My dotfiles

1. clone into home
1. run ~/dotfiles/make.sh

For the moment I'm primarily working on Ubuntu, with

* [vim](http://www.vim.org)
* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
* [bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html)

but when I'm using OSX I also like to use
* [slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate)
* [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/)


Here's how my terminal looks after running 'work'

DISCLAIMER: My [vimrc](vimrc) (and everything else) is setup the way I like it, for now, and will likely change whenever I feel like it. Use it at the risk of **Pandajail** where pandas are sent when you use someone else's `vimrc`. Don't be the vimmer responsible for this:
