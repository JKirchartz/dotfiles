# My dotfiles

I've been keeping my dotfiles in a git repo for 13 years, not really paying much attention to it, other than adding and tweaking stuff.
Now that 2025 is coming to a close, it's time for a Big Clean - to deduplicate cruft and organize everything in a way that makes sense...

for now, AFAIK, you can "install" my dotfiles the old way, but I might change things:

1. clone into home
1. run ~/dotfiles/make.sh
1. ???
1. profit

I'm primarily working with Debian-flavored Linux, with

* [vim](http://www.vim.org)
* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
* [bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html)

# DISCLAIMER: My [vimrc](//github.com/JKirchartz/vim) (and everything else) is setup the way I like it, for now, and will likely change whenever I feel like it.

Use it at the risk of **Pandajail** where pandas are sent when you use someone else's `vimrc`. Don't be the vimmer responsible for this:
