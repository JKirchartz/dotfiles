# My dotfiles

I've been keeping my dotfiles in a git repo for 13 years, not really paying
much attention to it, other than adding and tweaking stuff.  Now that 2025 is
coming to a close, it's time for a Big Clean - to deduplicate cruft and
organize everything in a way that makes sense - but only for me, you probably
don't want to use this... I might not even want to use this...

1. `git clone git@tildegit.git:jkirchartz/dotfiles.git .dotfiles`
1. `~/.dotfiles/dfm setup`
1. ???
1. profit

I'm primarily working with Debian-flavored Linux, with

* [vim](http://www.vim.org)
* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
* [bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html)

### DISCLAIMER: My [vimrc](//github.com/JKirchartz/vim) (and everything else) is setup the way I like it, for now, and will likely change whenever I feel like it.

Use it at the risk of **Pandajail** where pandas are sent when you use someone else's `vimrc`. Don't be the vimmer responsible for this:

### Concerns:

* might not know what to do with vim prior to v9.something (this is a problem for my vim config repo)
* might not know what to do with bash prior to v5.something (IDK, and I might not care...)
* I might time-travel to before these updates and be stuck with "too modern" config files that cause lots of errors (I'm looking at you, AntiX & everything else - computers are hard, lets take a nap)
* somebody else might try to use my workflow and discover that I'm quite insane.
